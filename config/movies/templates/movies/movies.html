            <h3 class="about_paragraph">This movie site was created as the latest practice to
                completion of offline courses at the Monday Academy, which was done by two people. May be considered
                copyright for this site (2023rd year). As conceived by the founders, their products were to enter
                every American home. After 20 years, we can conclude that the results even exceeded expectations.
                Now fresh new products from the company are eagerly awaited in different parts of the world. The
                stories are broadcast online wherever conditions are created for this. Therefore, we can safely say
                that the ideas of the studio have firmly entered not only houses, but also penetrated into the minds
                of people.
                You can watch with pleasure, but observe the measure. After all, the measure must be observed in
                everything.

                The reason for the triumph is obvious: she is one of the first to introduce all kinds of trends in the
                film industry. What is relevant in a specific period of time is immediately embodied in reality. This
                rule applies both to the technical possibilities of distributing films and series, and to filming the
                content that is most relevant. For example, in times of special love of people for videodiscs, it was
                possible to repeatedly watch your favorite works on just such a medium. Nowadays, there is only one way
                to reach the target audience as much as possible - this is online broadcasting. Therefore, all shows
                without exception can be found in this universal format.

                However, recently the company decided to expand the range and began to offer viewers products from
                third-party manufacturers. But even in this case, success is predictable, as experienced filmmakers
                select the best films for broadcast under their own brand. It looks like acquiring the rights to
                distribute various media projects, most of which are artistic paintings. The only thing that a
                well-known film supplier is not ready to give up is the predominance of the entertainment essence of its
                activities. People think that the films and series of this brand are really worth watching. This fact
                confirms the opinion of professional critics, who have repeatedly noted the work of the company with
                prestigious awards, including the Oscar.

                stories, and famous actors readily implement their ideas. This is also where new stars are born. The
                company is interested in a large number of viewers, so it actively attracts professional translators and
                foreign voice actors. It is not surprising that an impressive collection of films, series and cartoons
                has already accumulated in different languages.

                The emphasis is on the production of series, as this is a real gold mine for activating paid

                diversity in the choice of viewers. The collection includes all modern genres of the film industry.
                There are mysterious fantasy and bloody action movies, horror dramas and light comedies. The
                professional team does not forget about teenagers, for the sake of whom they shoot youth films on
